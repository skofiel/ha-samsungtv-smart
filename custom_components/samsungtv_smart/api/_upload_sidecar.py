"""Upload sidecar: make re-running a folder upload cheap and idempotent.

A JSON map ``{filename: {content_id, modified}}`` recording what was uploaded
and when. On the next run, files whose modification time is unchanged are
skipped, so re-uploading the same folder uploads 0 files instead of creating
duplicates on the TV.

All functions are synchronous and do blocking file I/O — call them from the
executor (``hass.async_add_executor_job``), never directly on the event loop.
