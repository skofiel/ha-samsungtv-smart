"""Artwork identification pipeline for Samsung Frame TVs (v8.4).

Two-stage, cache-first identification of the artwork currently shown on a
Frame TV:

1. **Reverse image search** — Google Cloud Vision *Web Detection* turns the
   thumbnail into concrete candidate titles/artists/pages pulled from the real
   web. This is the step a bare LLM cannot do (no vision model performs reverse
   image search; they identify "from memory" and hallucinate on obscure works).
2. **LLM confirmation** — an LLM (Anthropic, OpenAI or Gemini) is handed those
   candidates and the image, and asked to confirm ONLY if a candidate matches
   what it actually sees, otherwise return ``identified: false``. Feeding it
   real candidates collapses the hallucination surface: it verifies concrete
   names instead of guessing.

Everything is cached so the same artwork is never identified twice. The cache
key is chosen by how much we trust the Samsung id:

* ``SAM-*`` — global Art-Store catalogue id, stable across TV resets → the id
  is the key.
* anything else (``MY-*`` personal uploads, blank, unknown) — the id is a
  recyclable local slot number that a TV reset can re-assign to a different
  image, so it must NOT key the cache (a stale hit would show the wrong
  metadata). The key is the image content instead (``IMG-<sha256[:16]>``); the
  thumbnails we cache are the ones the integration downloaded, so they are
  byte-stable and hash reliably.

This module is provider-agnostic and free of Home Assistant entity code: it
takes the image bytes and the resolved config, and returns a plain dict. The
coordinator / sensor / service wiring lives elsewhere.
